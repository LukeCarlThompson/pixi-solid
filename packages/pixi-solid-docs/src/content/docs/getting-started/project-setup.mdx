### Creating a new project

To use `pixi-solid` you'll need to have a SolidJS project set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can create a new SolidJS project using the following command:

```bash
npm init solid@latest
```

This will create a new SolidJS project in a directory of your choice.

Next, install `pixi-solid` along with its peer dependency `pixi.js` in the new project you just created:

```bash
npm i pixi-solid pixi.js
```

### Existing project

If you already have a project setup you'll need to make sure that you also have `pixi.js` and `solid-js` installed.
Then you can just install `pixis-solid`.

```bash
npm i pixi-solid
```
