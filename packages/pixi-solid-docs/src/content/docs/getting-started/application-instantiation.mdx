### PixiCanvas

The `PixiCanvas` component is responsible for placing the HTML `<canvas>` element that PixiJS uses into the HTML page.
It can be used standalone or combined with `PixiApplicationProvider` for more control.

Some sensible defaults have been applied to make responsive behaviour of the `canvas` easier to work with:

- The `canvas` element is wrapped in a `div` that it automatically resizes to fit inside of it
- Any CSS styles can be applied to the wrapping `div` to reposition or resize the canvas
- The `canvas` listens for resizing of the wrapper `div` so it can adjust automatically if the page layout changes
- PixiJS application options (like `background`, `antialias`, `resolution`) can be passed directly to `PixiCanvas`

All your visual `pixi-solid` components, such as `Sprite`, `Graphics`, or other `Container`s, should be placed as children of `PixiCanvas`.
It handles the mounting and unmounting of your Pixi display object tree.

#### Simple Standalone Usage

The simplest way to get started is to use `PixiCanvas` directly. It will automatically create and manage the Pixi Application for you:

```tsx
import { PixiCanvas, Sprite } from "pixi-solid";
import { Texture } from "pixi.js";

const DemoPixiComponent = () => {
  return <Sprite texture={Texture.WHITE} scale={50} tint="#ff0000" />;
};

export const DemoApp = () => {
  return (
    <PixiCanvas style={{ width: "100%", height: "100vh" }}>
      <DemoPixiComponent />
    </PixiCanvas>
  );
};
```

#### With PixiApplicationProvider

For more advanced use cases where you need to access the Pixi application state from HTML components or use pixi-solid hooks outside of `PixiCanvas`, use `PixiApplicationProvider` as a wrapper:

```tsx
import { PixiApplicationProvider, PixiCanvas, usePixiScreen, getPixiApp, onTick, Text } from "pixi-solid";
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

export const DemoApp = () => {
  return (
    <PixiApplicationProvider background="#1099bb">
      {/* HTML components here can use pixi-solid hooks since they're inside the provider and will be rendered as siblings to the Pixi canvas element */}
      <HtmlComponent />
      <PixiCanvas style={{ width: "100%", height: "500px" }}>
        <CanvasContent />
      </PixiCanvas>
    </PixiApplicationProvider>
  );
};

const HtmlComponent = () => {
  /* HTML components inside PixiApplicationProvider can access pixi-solid hooks */

  const screen = usePixiScreen();

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: "20px" }}>
      <p>
        Screen Size: {screen.width}x{screen.height}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

const CanvasContent = () => {
  /* Pixi components inside PixiCanvas can also use pixi-solid hooks */

  const screen = usePixiScreen();

  return (
    <Text text="Hello from Pixi!" style={{ fill: "white", fontSize: 24 }} x={screen.width / 2} y={screen.height / 2} />
  );
};
```

<Aside type="tip">
  When using `PixiApplicationProvider`, any HTML components placed between the provider and the canvas can access
  pixi-solid hooks and the Pixi application context. This allows you to build UIs that react to Pixi app state, like
  displaying canvas dimensions or rendering status.
</Aside>

<Aside type={"caution"}>
  The `pixi-solid` library only supports client side rendering. So you may need to use the `lazy` function to
  dynamically import only on the client or use the `clientOnly` function if using Solid Start.
