### Instantiating the Pixi Application

To start rendering in PixiJS, you'll need to create a `PixiApplication` component that will instantiate the `PIXI.Application` instance and provide it to all child components via context.
It acts as the root of your Pixi Solid application and provider for all the pixi-solid hooks.
It accepts all PixiJS application options as props.
There should only be one of these per project.

<Aside type="tip">
  The `PixiApplication` component doesn't actually add any elements to the DOM, we need to use the `PixiCanvas` for
  that. This means that if any HTML components need access to any of the pixi-solid hooks or application state they can
  be rendered as children of `PixiApplication` but need to be outside of the `PixiCanvas` component.
</Aside>

### PixiCanvas

The `PixiCanvas` component needs to be a child of `PixiApplication`.
It's responsible for placing the the HTML `<canvas>` element that PixiJS uses into the HTML page.

Some sensible defaults have been applied here to make responsive behaviour of the `canvas` a little easier to work with.

The `canvas` element is wrapped in a `div` that it will automatically resize to fit inside of.
This means that we can use any CSS styles we like to reposition or resize the wrapping `div` and our PixiJS `canvas` will respond automatically.
You can apply standard HTML attributes and styling to the `canvas` wrapper `div` via component props.

The `canvas` is set to listen for resizing of the wrapper `div` so it can adjust auotmatically if the page layout changes even if the `window` size didn't change.

### PixiStage

`PixiCanvas` only accepts one child, the `PixiStage` component.
This provides the root `PIXI.Container` (the `app.stage` instance) for all your PixiJS display objects.
All your visual `pixi-solid` components, such as `Sprite`, `Graphics`, or other `Container`s, should be placed as children of `PixiStage`.
It handles the mounting and unmounting of your Pixi display object tree.

```tsx
import { PixiApplication, PixiCanvas, PixiStage } from "pixi-solid";

/**
 * The DemoApp component sets up the Pixi Application
 * and can be mounted anywhere in your SolidJS app.
 * It will render a Canvas element with a Pixi Stage inside it.
 */
export const DemoApp = () => {
  return (
    <PixiApplication>
      <PixiCanvas>
        <PixiStage>{/* Your Pixi Solid components go here */}</PixiStage>
      </PixiCanvas>
    </PixiApplication>
  );
};
```

<Aside type={"caution"}>
  The `pixi-solid` library only supports client side rendering. So you may need to use the `lazy` function to
  dynamically import only on the client or use the `clientOnly` function if using Solid Start.
