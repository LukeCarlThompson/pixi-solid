### Instantiating the Pixi Application

To start rending in PixiJS, you'll need to create a `PixiApplication` component that will instantiate the `PIXI.Application` instance and provide it to all child components via context.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

```tsx
import { PixiApplication, PixiCanvas, PixiStage } from "pixi-solid";

/**
 * The DemoApp component sets up the Pixi Application
 * and can be mounted anywhere in your SolidJS app.
 * It will render a Canvas element with a Pixi Stage inside it.
 */
export const DemoApp = () => {
  return (
    <PixiApplication>
      <PixiCanvas>
        <PixiStage>{/* Your Pixi Solid components go here */}</PixiStage>
      </PixiCanvas>
    </PixiApplication>
  );
};
```

<Aside>
  The `pixi-solid` library only supports client side rendering. So you may need to use the `lazy` helper to dynamically
  import on the client or use the `import {clientOnly} from "@solidjs/start";` if using Solid Start.
