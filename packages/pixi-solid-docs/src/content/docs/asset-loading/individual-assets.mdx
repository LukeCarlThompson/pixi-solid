When building a Pixi.js application with `pixi-solid`, you often need to load assets like images, spritesheets, or fonts. Solid.js's `createResource` function provides an excellent way to handle asynchronous data loading, including assets, while integrating seamlessly with Solid's reactivity system.

This guide demonstrates how to load individual assets using `createResource` and Pixi.js's `Assets` manager.

## Using `createResource` for Individual Assets

The `createResource` function in Solid.js is ideal for fetching data that might take some time to load. By integrating it with Pixi.js's `Assets.load()`, you can easily manage the loading state of your textures and other assets.

### Example: Loading a Single Image

Let's say you want to load a single background image for your scene.

```tsx
import type * as Pixi from "pixi.js";
import { Assets } from "pixi.js";
import { PixiApplication, PixiCanvas, PixiStage, Sprite } from "pixi-solid";
import { createResource, Show } from "solid-js";

export const IndividualAssetLoadingDemo = () => {
  // Use createResource to load a single asset
  const [backgroundImage] = createResource(async () => {
    // Initialize Pixi.js Assets manager if not already done globally
    await Assets.init();
    // Load a single asset by its path
    const texture = await Assets.load<Pixi.Texture>("/background.png");
    return texture;
  });

  return (
    <PixiApplication background={0x1099bb}>
      <PixiCanvas>
        {/* Use the <Show> component to render the Sprite only when the asset is loaded */}
        <Show when={backgroundImage()}>
          {(texture) => (
            <PixiStage>
              <Sprite texture={texture()} anchor={0.5} position={[400, 300]} scale={0.5} />
            </PixiStage>
          )}
        </Show>
      </PixiCanvas>
    </PixiApplication>
  );
};
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`createResource(async () => { ... })`**: We wrap the asset loading logic inside an `async` function passed to `createResource`.
2.  **`Assets.init()`**: It's good practice to ensure the `Assets` manager is initialized but we only need to do this once per application.
3.  **`Assets.load<Pixi.Texture>("/background.png")`**: This loads the specified image file and returns a `Promise` that resolves with the `Pixi.Texture` object.
4.  **`[backgroundImage]`**: `createResource` returns a signal-like tuple. `backgroundImage` will be `undefined` initially, then a `Promise`, and finally the loaded `Pixi.Texture`.
5.  **`<Show when={backgroundImage()}> ... </Show>`**: The `Show` component from Solid.js is used to conditionally render the `Sprite` only when `backgroundImage()` evaluates to a truthy value (i.e., when the texture has finished loading). The loaded `texture` is then passed to the `Sprite` component.

This approach ensures that your Pixi.js components only try to render assets once they are fully loaded.
