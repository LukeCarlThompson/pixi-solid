title: Loading an Asset Manifest
description: Learn how to load multiple assets efficiently using an asset manifest with Solid.js's createResource in pixi-solid.
---

For applications with many assets, managing individual asset loading can become cumbersome.
Pixi.js provides a robust **Asset Manifest** system that allows you to define all your assets, their paths, and groups in a single JSON file.
This approach simplifies asset management, improves organization, and enables more efficient loading strategies.

It's recommended to use PixiJs [AssetPack](https://pixijs.io/assetpack/) to generate the asset manifest automatically for you.

This guide demonstrates how to use Solid.js's `createResource` to load an entire asset manifest and then access the loaded assets within your `pixi-solid` application.

## What is an Asset Manifest?

An asset manifest is a JSON file that describes your application's assets. It typically includes:

- **`bundles`**: Groups of assets that can be loaded together. This is extremely useful for loading assets required for a specific scene or component.
- **`assets`**: Individual assets with their unique `alias` (how you refer to them in code) and `src` (their file path).

### Example `assets-manifest.json`

Let's assume you have an `assets-manifest.json` file in your `public` folder like this:

```json
{
  "bundles": [
    {
      "name": "game-assets",
      "assets": [
        {
          "alias": "background",
          "src": "/assets/background.png"
        },
        {
          "alias": "player_idle",
          "src": "/assets/player_idle.png"
        },
        {
          "alias": "coin",
          "src": "/assets/coin.png"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "ui-assets",
      "assets": [
        {
          "alias": "button_play",
          "src": "/assets/button_play.png"
        },
        {
          "alias": "font_pixel",
          "src": "/assets/pixel_font.fnt"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

With `createResource`, you can easily load your manifest and then use Pixi.js's `Assets` manager to load the bundles defined within it.

### Example: Loading Assets from a Manifest

```tsx
import type * as Pixi from "pixi.js";
import { Assets } from "pixi.js";
import { PixiApplication, PixiCanvas, Sprite, Text } from "pixi-solid";
import { createResource, Show, createSignal } from "solid-js";

export const AssetManifestLoadingDemo = () => {
  // Use createResource to initialize Assets and load the manifest
  const [assetsLoaded] = createResource(async () => {
    // 1. Initialize Pixi.js Assets manager
    await Assets.init({
      manifest: "/assets-manifest.json", // Specify your manifest file here
    });

    // 2. Load a specific bundle (or all bundles if you don't specify)
    // Here, we load the "game-assets" bundle.
    await Assets.loadBundle("game-assets");

    // We can also load other bundles as needed, or all of them.
    await Assets.loadBundle("ui-assets");

    // Return a boolean or any indicator that assets are ready
    return true;
  });

  return (
    <PixiApplication>
    {/* Suspense will show the fallback while any resources inside it are pending */}
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
        <PixiCanvas>
          {/* Use <Show> to render components only after assets are loaded */}
          <Show when={assetsLoaded()}>
            {/* Access assets using their alias defined in the manifest */}
            <Sprite texture={Assets.get<Pixi.Texture>("background")} anchor={0.5} position={[400, 300]} scale={0.8} />
            <Sprite texture={Assets.get<Pixi.Texture>("player_idle")} anchor={0.5} position={[400, 300]} />
            <Sprite texture={Assets.get<Pixi.Texture>("coin")} anchor={0.5} position={[450, 250]} />
            <Sprite texture={Assets.get<Pixi.Texture>("button_play")} anchor={0.5} position={[400, 450]} />
            <Text
              text="Game Loaded!"
              style={{ fontFamily: "font_pixel", fontSize: 32, fill: 0xffffff }}
              position={[200, 50]}
            />
          </Show>
        </PixiCanvas>
      <Suspense>
    </PixiApplication>
  );
};
```

If we have a HTML based SolidJS app we can go further and put the Suspense boundary around a `lazy` dynamic import of our whole pixi-solid app.
That way we could show a HTML loading indicator before we even start loading PixiJS itself.

Using an asset manifest is a powerful way to streamline asset loading in larger `pixi-solid` applications and we can combine with the SolidJS built in `createResource` and `<Suspense>` to manage loading states.
