The `pixi-solid` library provides two hooks, `useTicker` and `useTick`, to interact with the Pixi.js `Ticker` instance. The `Ticker` is responsible for driving the animation loop in a Pixi.js application, making it essential for any dynamic or animated content.

Both hooks must be called from a component that is a descendant of the `<PixiApplication />`component. If used outside of this context, they will throw an error.

## `useTicker` Hook

The `useTicker` hook provides direct access to the `PIXI.Application`'s shared `Ticker` instance. This is useful when you need more control over the ticker, such as pausing, starting, or adjusting its speed globally.

### Usage

```tsx
import { useTicker, Container } from "pixi-solid";
import { createEffect, createSignal } from "solid-js";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [tickerRunning, setTickerRunning] = createSignal(true);
  const ticker = useTicker();

  createEffect(() => {
    // You can now safely use the Pixi.js Ticker instance
    console.log("Pixi.js Ticker instance:", ticker);

    // Example start and stop the ticker based on a signal
    if (tickerRunning()) {
      ticker.start();
    } else {
      ticker.stop();
    }
  });

  return <Container>{/* Your components here*/}</Container>;
};
```

### When to use it

- When you need to globally control the animation loop (e.g., stopping or starting all animations).
- To adjust the overall speed or framerate of the application.
- To add or remove ticker callbacks dynamically based on complex logic.
