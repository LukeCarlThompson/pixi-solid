The `onTick` hook is a more focused utility for registering a callback function to be executed on every frame of the `PIXI.Application`'s ticker.
The callback is automatically added when the component mounts and removed when the component or hook's owning computation is cleaned up, ensuring proper resource management.

It must be called within a SolidJS tracking scope, such as a component or another hook, that is a descendant of `PixiApplication`.

### Usage

```tsx
import { onTick, Sprite } from "pixi-solid";
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";
import * as Pixi from "pixi.js";

const RotatingSpriteBySignal = (props: { texture: Pixi.Texture }) => {
  const [rotation, setRotation] = createSignal(0);

  onTick((ticker) => {
    // Set a signal every frame
    setRotation((r) => r + 0.01 * ticker.deltaTime);
  });

  return <Sprite texture={props.texture} anchor={0.5} rotation={rotation()} />;
};

const RotatingSprite = (props: { texture: Pixi.Texture }) => {
  return (
    <Sprite
      texture={props.texture}
      anchor={0.5}
      ref={(sprite) => {
        onTick((ticker) => {
          // Update rotation directly every frame
          // Slightly more efficient but limited in scope
          sprite.rotation = sprite.rotation + 0.01 * ticker.deltaTime;
        });
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

### When to use it

- Any time you want to subscribe to the ticker for the lifetime of a SolidJS tracking scope (component or createEffect).
- When you need a simple and self-managing way to run code on each ticker update without directly managing `ticker.add` and `ticker.remove`.
- For creating continuous animations, movement, or other frame-by-frame updates within a component.
