The `getPixiApp` hook provides a way to access the root `PIXI.Application` instance created by the `PixiApplicationProvider` or `PixiCanvas` component.
This is useful when you need to interact directly with the Pixi.js application, for example, to access the renderer.

## Usage

This hook must be called from a component that is a descendant of the `<PixiApplicationProvider />` or `<PixiCanvas />` component.
If used outside of this context, it will throw an error.

```tsx
import { getPixiApp, Container, PixiCanvas } from "pixi-solid";
import { createEffect } from "solid-js";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const app = getPixiApp();

  createEffect(() => {
    // You can now safely use the Pixi.js Application instance
    console.log("Pixi.js Application instance:", app);
  });

  return <Container>{/* Your components here*/}</Container>;
};

export const DemoApp = () => {
  return (
    <PixiCanvas>
      <MyComponent />
    </PixiCanvas>
  );
};
```

## When to use it

- When you need direct access to the `PIXI.Application` instance to perform operations not covered by specific `pixi-solid` components.
- To get information about the Pixi.js renderer, such as its dimensions, resolution, or view.
