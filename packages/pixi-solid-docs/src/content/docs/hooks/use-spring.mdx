import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import demoCode from "../../demos/use-spring.demo.tsx?raw";
import { ClientOnly } from "../../demos/client-only";

The `useSpring` hook provides reactive SolidJS signals for creating physically-based spring animations for numeric values. It returns both the `value` and `velocity` of the spring as signals.

The hook internally manages the spring physics calculations and keeps its updates synchronized with the Pixi.js application's ticker, ensuring smooth and responsive animations that align with your application's frame rate.

It must be called within a SolidJS tracking scope, such as a component or another hook, that is a descendant of `PixiApplication`.

### Demo

Taking our earlier `useSmoothDamp` demo and applying `useSpring` gives us an altogether different feeling motion.

<ClientOnly fileName="use-spring" client:only="solid-js" />

### Code example

<Code code={demoCode} lang="tsx" title="demo-app.tsx" />
