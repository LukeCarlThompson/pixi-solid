import { ClientOnly } from "../../demos/client-only";

The `useSmoothDamp` hook provides a reactive SolidJS signal that smoothly interpolates a numeric value towards a target value over time.
It internally manages the damping physics and keeps its updates synchronized with the Pixi.js application's ticker, ensuring smooth animations that sync with your application's frame rate.

This hook is similar in functionality to Unity's `Mathf.SmoothDamp` which is based on Game Programming Gems 4, Chapter 1.10.

It must be called within a SolidJS tracking scope, such as a component or another hook, that is a descendant of `PixiApplication`.

### Demo

Taking our earlier dragging demo and applying `useSmoothDamp` to the dragging motion.

<ClientOnly fileName="use-smooth-damp" client:only="solid-js" />
