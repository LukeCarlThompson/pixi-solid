The `delay` hook provides a way to delay execution for a specified number of milliseconds of ticker time.

It ensures that the delay is in sync with the shared ticker's time units, making it ideal for animations or syncing with other actions based on ticker time.

The delay is synchronized with the shared ticker, so it will not progress if the ticker is paused or stopped.

This hook must be called within a SolidJS tracking scope, such as a component or another hook, that is a descendant of `PixiApplication` or `TickerProvider`.

### Usage

```tsx
import { delay, Text } from "pixi-solid";

const DelayedActionComponent = () => {
  const handlePointerDown = async () => {
    await delay(2000);
    console.log("2 seconds have passed!");
  };

  return <Text text={"Click me"} onpointerdown={handlePointerDown} />;
};

const DelayedCallbackComponent = () => {
  const handlePointerDown = () => {
    delay(1000, () => {
      console.log("1 second has passed!");
    });
  };

  return <Text text={"Click me"} onpointerdown={handlePointerDown} />;
};
```

### When to use it

- When you need to delay execution in a way that is synchronized with the ticker.
- For animations or other operations that depend on the ticker's timing.
- To avoid using external time measurements like `setTimeout` in ticker-dependent contexts.
