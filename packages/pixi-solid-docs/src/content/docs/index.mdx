### Features

Pixi Solid is a library that provides [SolidJS](https://docs.solidjs.com/) components and hooks for working with [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/).

- 💙 Lightweight and flexible SolidJS library for creating PixiJS applications.
- 🎁 Provides a set of custom SolidJS components that create PixiJS objects instead of HTML elements.
- 📦 Supports all PixiJS objects, such as Filter, Container, Sprite, Graphics, Text, etc.
- 🧑‍💻 The convenience and speed of SolidJS stores and signals to manage state.
- ✨ All events emitted by PixiJS objects are supported.
- 😎 No limitations. Break out of SolidJS any time and interact directly with PixiJS.
- 💫 Useful helper utilities included.
- 🤩 Full Typescript support for type safety and auto completion.

### Why combine SolidJS with PixiJS?

- **Declarative PixiJS scene graph**: Using SolidJS's JSX templating means we get declarative control over the scene graph. No longer necessary to imperatively add and remove children.

- **Lifecycle hooks in our PixiJS components**: SolidJS rendering PixiJS components means we can take advantage of the built in lifecycle methods in SolidJS `onMount` and `onCleanup` as well as few extra custom hooks so we can automatically subscribe and unsubscribe from the ticker.

- **Shared State and Reactivity**: Pixi Solid leverages SolidJS's reactivity system to automatically update PixiJS components when SolidJS signals or stores change. So your HTML and PixiJS graphics can stay in sync effortlessly.

- **Combine the best of both worlds**: Pixi Solid makes it easy to use HTML elements alongside a PixiJS canvas, allowing you to create rich user interfaces that combine the strengths of both technologies.

- **Composability**: Pixi Solid components can be easily composed together to create complex scenes and animations out of reusable components.

- **SolidJS is a thin wrapper**: While Pixi Solid provides a nice abstraction over PixiJS it provides access to all the properties and events of PixiJS objects.

- **SolidJS is really fast**: SolidJs is on of the fatsest front-end frameworks out there so the overhead is very minimal.

- **SolidJS is fully featured**: It has stores, signals, suspense, error boundaries, resource fetching and more. It's a great feature set for simple or complex applications and you won't have to reach for other libraries to manage templating or state.
