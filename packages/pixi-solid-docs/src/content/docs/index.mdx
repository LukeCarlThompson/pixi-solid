### Overview?

Pixi Solid is a library that provides [SolidJS](https://docs.solidjs.com/) components and hooks for working with [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/), a popular 2D rendering engine for the web.

All that's needed to get started is a basic understanding of both SolidJS and PixiJS.
If you're new to either library, be sure to check out their respective documentation to get up to speed.

### Why use it?

- **SolidJS integration**: Pixi Solid provides a set of SolidJS components and hooks that make it easy to work with PixiJS in a SolidJS application.

- **HTML and PixiJS together**: Pixi Solid makes it easy to use HTML elements alongside a PixiJS canvas, allowing you to create rich user interfaces that combine the strengths of both technologies.

- **Shared State and Reactivity**: Pixi Solid leverages SolidJS's reactivity system to automatically update PixiJS components when SolidJS signals or stores change. So your HTML and PixiJS graphics can stay in sync effortlessly.

- **Declarative syntax**: Pixi Solid allows you to use a declarative syntax to define your PixiJS scenes, making it easier to read and maintain your code.

- **Composability**: Pixi Solid components can be easily composed together to create complex scenes and animations.

- **Freedom to use all PixiJS features**: While Pixi Solid provides a high-level abstraction over PixiJS, it doesn't limit your ability to use low level PixiJS features to create custom PixiJS components and wrap into a SolidJS component for composability and reusability.

- **TypeScript support**: Pixi Solid is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions for all components and hooks, making it easy to use in TypeScript projects.
