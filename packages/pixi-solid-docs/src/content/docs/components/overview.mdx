### Available components

Most of the PixiJS display components are available as Solid components in Pixi Solid.

All components are named the same as their PixiJS counterparts and should be imported individually.

This pattern also allows treeshaking when using a bundler that supports it as each component only imports the necessary parts of PixiJS that it needs.

All of the components take the same props as their PixiJS counterparts, with the addition of event handlers.

These include:

```ts
import {
  AnimatedSprite,
  BitmapText,
  Container,
  Graphics,
  HTMLText,
  MeshPlane,
  MeshRope,
  MeshSimple,
  NineSliceSprite,
  ParticleContainer,
  PerspectiveMesh,
  RenderContainer,
  RenderLayer,
  Sprite,
  Text,
  TilingSprite,
} from "pixi-solid";
```

This can cause some name clashes if you are also importing classes or types from `pixi.js` directly.

It's recommended to alias the imports from `pixi.js` in these cases, for example:

```ts
import { Sprite as PixiSprite } from "pixi.js";
import { Sprite } from "pixi-solid";
//...
```

Or import all Pixi types under a namespace because these will not be bundled into the final build anyway:

```ts
import * as Pixi from "pixi.js";
import { Sprite } from "pixi-solid";

//...

let spriteRef: Pixi.Sprite | undefined;
//...
```

### Omissions

There's a few deliberate omossions of PixiJS classes from the components list because wrapping them in a SolidJS component doesn't add much value. These include:

- `Particle`
  Particles inside a `ParticleContainer` are intended for when you want to the maximum performance for a particle system so a dedicated component here is in opposition to that.
  It's recommended to create and manage the particle instances imperatively with a `<ParticleContainer />` as a parent..

- `MeshGeometry`
- `NineSliceGeometry`
- `PerspectivePlaneGeometry`
- `PlaneGeometry`
- `RopeGeometry`
  The geometry classes are pretty low level and generally used when creating custom meshes.
  This kind of work is best created once imperatively with PixiJS directly and then wrapped in a custom `pixi-solid` component.

- `Culler`
  It may be worth adding in the future.
  Have't experimented enough with this one to know if a SolidJS component would be useful just yet.
