title: Animated Sprite
description: A reference page in my new Starlight docs site.

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import code from "../../examples/animated-sprite.tsx?raw";
import { ClientOnly } from "../../examples/client-only";

Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what you're documenting.

<ClientOnly filePath="./animated-sprite" client:only="solid-js" />

<Code code={code} lang="tsx" title={"AnimatedSprite"} />
