description: An example of using filters in solid-pixi.

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import demoCode from "../../demos/filters.demo.tsx?raw";
import { ClientOnly } from "../../demos/client-only";

To use PixiJS filters we should instantiate them directly from the PixiJS classes and then bind them to any properties we want to change with signals.

Don't forget that any PixiJS classes we insantiate direcly we need to manually destory them when our component is cleaned up.
SolidJs makes this really easy with the `onCleanup` hook.

Please see the [PixiJS docs](https://pixijs.download/release/docs/filters.html) for detailed information.

### Demo

Move your mouse left to right across the sky to adjust the strength of the blur filter.

<ClientOnly fileName="filters" client:only="solid-js" />

### Code example

<Code code={demoCode} lang="tsx" title="filters-demo.tsx" />
