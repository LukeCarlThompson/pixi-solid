description: An example of passing props through a component.

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import demoCode from "../../demos/pass-through-props.demo.tsx?raw";
import exampleCode from "../../demos/pass-through-props.tsx?raw";
import { ClientOnly } from "../../demos/client-only";

### Demo

Move your mouse or touch across the canvas to change the flying speed of the bird.

<ClientOnly fileName="pass-through-props" client:only="solid-js" />

### Code example

When creating custom components, it's often useful to pass props through to underlying PixiJS components.
This allows for greater flexibility by gaining access to properties such as position, scale or adding event listeners from the outside.

Instead of writing them out one by one, you can use the utility type `PixiComponentProps` which contains props for the PixiJS `Container` but you can extend it by passing in the specific component type a generic `PixiComponentProps<Pixi.SpriteOptions>`.
It may be useful to combine with the built itn `Omit` or `Pick` utility types to exclude or include specific props.
Combined with the SolidJS `splitProps` helper and the spread `{...props}` syntax we can pass all received props or only a specific group of them down to the underlying component.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pass-through-props-example.tsx">
    <Code code={exampleCode} lang="tsx" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="demo-app.tsx">
    <Code code={demoCode} lang="tsx" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
