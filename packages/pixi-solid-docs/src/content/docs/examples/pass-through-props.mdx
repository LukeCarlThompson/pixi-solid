import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import demoCode from "../../examples/pass-through-props.demo.tsx?raw";
import exampleCode from "../../examples/pass-through-props.tsx?raw";
import { ClientOnly } from "../../examples/client-only";

### Demo

Move your mouse or touch across the canvas to change the flying speed of the bird.

<ClientOnly fileName="pass-through-props" client:only="solid-js" />

### Code example

When creating custom components, it's often useful to pass props through to underlying PixiJS components.
This allows for greater flexibility by gaining access to properties such as position, scale or adding event listeners from the outside.

Instead of writing them out one by one, you can use the Pixi Options type of the object you're passing them into.
Combined with the SolidJS `splitProps` helper and the spread `{...props}` syntax we can pass all received props or only a specific group of them down to the underlying component.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="sprite.tsx">
    <Code code={exampleCode} lang="tsx" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="demo-app.tsx">
    <Code code={demoCode} lang="tsx" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
