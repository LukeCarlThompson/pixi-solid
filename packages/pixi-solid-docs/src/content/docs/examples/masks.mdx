description: An example of using masks in solid-pixi.

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import demoCode from "../../examples/masks.demo.tsx?raw";
import { ClientOnly } from "../../examples/client-only";

Masks work the same way as in PixiJS.
The object being used as a masks needs to be added to the `Stage` and set as a `mask` property on the object to be masked.

Please see the [PixiJS docs](https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/scene-objects#masking-scene-objects) for detailed information.

### Demo

Move your mouse across the screen to change the mask position.

<ClientOnly fileName="masks" client:only="solid-js" />

### Code example

<Code code={demoCode} lang="tsx" title="masks-demo.tsx" />
