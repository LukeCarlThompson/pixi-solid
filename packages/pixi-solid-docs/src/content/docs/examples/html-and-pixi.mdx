title: HTML and PixiJS
description: An example of mixing HTML and PixiJS together.
---

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import demoCode from "../../demos/html-and-pixi.demo.tsx?raw";
import { ClientOnly } from "../../demos/client-only";

This example demonstrates how to combine HTML elements with pixi-solid components and share state between them.

HTML input controls update SolidJS signals, which then reactively update pixi-solid graphics in real-time.

### Demo

<ClientOnly fileName="html-and-pixi" client:only="solid-js" />

### Code example

<Code code={demoCode} lang="tsx" title="html-and-pixi.demo.tsx" />
