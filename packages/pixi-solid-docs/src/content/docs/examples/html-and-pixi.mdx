title: HTML and PixiJS
description: An example of passing props through a component.

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import demoCode from "../../examples/pass-through-props.demo.tsx?raw";
import exampleCode from "../../examples/pass-through-props.tsx?raw";
import { ClientOnly } from "../../examples/client-only";

### Demo

HTML elements and a PixiJS canvas can coexist on the same page and we can use SolidJS templating with signals and stores to control the state of both together.

It's a great way to use HTML for responsive layouts, text and UI controls alongside a PixiJS powered canvas for graphics and animations.

<ClientOnly fileName="pass-through-props" client:only="solid-js" />

### Code example

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="pass-through-props-example.tsx">
    <Code code={exampleCode} lang="tsx" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="demo-app.tsx">
    <Code code={demoCode} lang="tsx" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
